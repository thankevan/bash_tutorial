1.
What's your full path?


2.
Create a directory structure like `dir1/dir2/dir3` and get back to the tutorial directory.
How would you do that with only one command?


3.
Go to `dir2`.


4.
Copy `lesson0_assignment.txt` into `dir2`.
Whoops, move the copy from `dir2` to `dir3` and give it a different name.


5.
Get back to the tutorial directory.
Delete `dir1` and everything underneath it in one fell swoop...
but make sure the computer gets your confirmation before deleting.

6.
List the files, including hidden ones, with permissions and sizes in `folder`.
